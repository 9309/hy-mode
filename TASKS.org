** TODO Merge the pytest integration from Spacemacs python layer
* Tracked Issues
** TODO #44: Macro with body indentation fix

Need to investigate.

** TODO #46: Inferior Lisp colored output

Need to investigate.

** TODO #47: tab completion not working in inferior lisp

Need to investigate.

* Known Minor Bugs
** TODO Font-lock-doc-face entirely determined by parent sexp
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defn hi [] "docstring" "return value")
#+END_SRC

will also use font-lock-doc-face for "return value"

This is rarely an issue as in cases like:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defn hi [] "docstring" ["1" "2"])
#+END_SRC
the 1 and 2 will use the correct face as the parent sexp is the list.

** TODO Only first name is highlighted in setv/def
* Questions
** TODO Is the 'Note for Windows Users' relevant anymore?
