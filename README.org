An Emacs major mode for [[http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/][Hy, lisp python]] providing:

1. Syntax Highlighting
2. Auto-completion
3. Shell integration
4. New Hy constructs like bracket strings

** Installation

~hy-mode~ requires Emacs 24+ and is available in MELPA. For the most current set
of features download use master.

** Spacemacs Users

Hy-mode is in active development and Spacemacs does not reflect the most current work.

Require ~spacemacs-hy~ to enable auto-completion and bindings for the new shell
functions. See that file for all available bindings.
