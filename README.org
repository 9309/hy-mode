An Emacs major mode for [[http://docs.hylang.org/en/stable/][Hy]], lispy python, providing support for:

1. Syntax Highlighting
2. Auto-completion
3. Eldoc and documentation lookup
4. Shell integration
5. Hy constructs like bracket strings

Spacemacs users - Hy has its own layer in its dev branch.

** Installation

Master branch is currently in development. Please use the latest tagged release
for a smoother experience.

~hy-mode~ requires Emacs 24+ and is available in MELPA.

** Contributing

~hy-mode~ is *very* well-tested. It uses [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/emacs-buttercup][buttercup]] rather than ~ert~.

Execute tests after running ~cask install~ with the command: ~cask exec buttercup -L .~

Process-based tests currently rely on setting ~hy-test--pyvenv-name~ to the name
of a virtual environment containing Hy, see ~hy-test.el~. If not set, then
a warning will be given and process-based tests will be skipped.
